Phone number parser for telephone numbers in international standard or missing international country code, for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org).

Note on version `0.4.0` onward: `Phone` was rebuild to increase performance, that may increase compilation time but made `Phone` 100 times faster.

## About

What is, what isn't and what will be about Phone:
  1. It isn't:
     * Intended to work as libphonenumber.
     * Prepared to format numbers.
     * Necessary any information about the number if in international standard.
  2. It is:
     * A real parser, created to extract information based only in the number.
     * Prepared to work with numbers not only in the international standard.
  3. It will have:
     * Area code info for every country that numbering plan has area codes.

  * Patterns:
    * Countries without area code info:
        ```elixir
        %{
          country: "Country Name",
          a2: "Alpha-2",
          a3: "Alpha-3",
          international_code: "1",
          area_code: "yyy",
          number: "xxxxxxx"
        }
        ```

    * Countries with area code info:
        ```elixir
        %{
          country: "Country Name",
          a2: "Alpha-2 code",
          a3: "Alpha-3 code",
          international_code: "1",
          number: "xxxxxxx",
          area_code: "yyy",
          area_name: "Area Name",
          area_type: "state",
          area_abbreviation: "AN"
        }
        ```

## Area Codes

  Countries that already has area code info:
  * United States.
  * Canada.
  * Brazil.
  * Spain.

## Vocabulary

  * a2: Alpha-2, two letters code for country names.
  * a3: Alpha-3, three letters code for country names.
  * NANP: North American Numbering Plan, numbering plan for countries with international code number 1.
  * Numbering Plan: The rules and specifications of how telephone numbers works in a given country.
